    <h1> ABOUT hElPeRdRoMel</h1>
<p>this site was built and is maintained by me, friday k. I am a student who wants to be a hacker when they're older, and I really enjoy learning about computers. I find the internet facisnating, and I want to bend it to my will for the purpose of social justive, because I think that it cna be used a for a lot of good things. I love werwolves, cowboys, and music, and you can find my bandcamp @ i.luv.werewolves! head to the contact page for ways to reach out to me if there is a problem on my website. </p>
